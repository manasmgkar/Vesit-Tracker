# Vesit-Tracker

College's website is slow and in the exam season it gets worse.This tool fetches results directly from the databse and sends it to the students as soon as results are uploaded on the Database.It Way faster than one can download it manually.

Solves the problem of students missing exams,other notifications by emailing it to specific departments the notification is for.Since everything is uploaded on the site and students dont really bother to check it. 

### Note To VESIT Students : 

Don't Deploy this unless you wanna be repremanded for doxing/polling the Database.
